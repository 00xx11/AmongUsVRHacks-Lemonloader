# AmongUsVRHacks
a barely working melonloader hack client for amongus vr (only works for steamvr/pc)

## THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

## TO USE THIS YOU MUST BE USING PCVR/STEAMVR. THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR QUEST, PLAYSTATION, OR ANYTHING OTHER THAN STEAMVR.

### This is a melonloader mod, meaning you have to be using melonloader to run it. To install melonloader, click here: [https://melonwiki.xyz/](https://melonwiki.xyz/)

current features include:
- no-clip (disabling colliders and the blinding box - currently only works on skeld right now) -- Press "C" to toggle
- speed increase -- Press "S" to toggle
- force show imposters (this only works if you're the host i think) -- Press "I" to toggle

planned features:
- WallHacks (allows you to see players through walls)
- kill alerts (alerts you when someone kills someone else)
- minigame/task autocompleter
- unignore ghosts (will allow you to see and talk to dead players)
- dead interact (will allow you to interact with stuff that you normally cant interact with when you're dead, i.e. voting, sabotages, etc)

this was mostly made by using unity explorer to dig around in the game, so if you want to contribute, keep that in mind

the end result will probably have rly low code quality and wont work very well, but its better than nothing :3 

also dont use it for malicious purposes pls
