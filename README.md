# AmongUsVRHacks
a barely working melonloader hack client for amongus vr (only works for steamvr/pc)

## THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

## TO USE THIS YOU MUST BE USING PCVR/STEAMVR. THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR QUEST, PLAYSTATION, OR ANYTHING OTHER THAN STEAMVR.

### This is a melonloader mod, meaning you have to be using melonloader to run it. To install melonloader, click here: [https://melonwiki.xyz/](https://melonwiki.xyz/)

### I'm planning on making an auto-installer that you can run to install melonloader and the mod automatically, but for now, you have to do all of it manually.

current features include:
- no kill cooldown (makes you able to kill everyone instantly while imposter) -- Press "K" to toggle
- no-clip (disabling colliders and the blinding box - currently only works on skeld right now) -- Press "C" to toggle
- speed increase -- Press "S" to toggle
- force show imposters (this only works if you're the host i think) -- Press "I" to toggle
- WallHacks (allows you to see players through walls) -- Press "W" to toggle
- force imposter (only works if you're the host) -- Press "F" to become imposter while you're the host
- auto updater

planned features:
- kill alerts (alerts you when someone kills someone else)
- minigame/task autocompleter
- unignore ghosts (will allow you to see and talk to dead players)
- dead interact (will allow you to interact with stuff that you normally cant interact with when you're dead, i.e. voting, sabotages, etc)
- teleporter (will let you teleport to other players)
- alwayslight (allows you to see when the lights are out or the view distance is turned down)
- tracers (draws a line from you to other players)
- a clickgui for toggling and configuring modules

this was mostly made by using unity explorer to dig around in the game, so if you want to contribute, keep that in mind

the end result will probably have rly low code quality and wont work very well, but its better than nothing :3 

if you want to suggest new features then open an issue and i'll get to it

if you dont like my code quality then dont open issues send prs

also dont use it for malicious purposes pls
